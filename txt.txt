While this book is written for 12+ year old kids, adults looking for an easy intro to
Java may find this book useful as well. In the book youâ€™ll be using the same tools used
by professional programmers. As a bonus, the last chapter will teach you how to publish
your code on the Web on a super popular site called GitHub. Millions of programmers share
their programs there, and you should too.
